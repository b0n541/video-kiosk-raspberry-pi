# video-kiosk-raspberry-pi

This is a description on how I created a video kiosk system based on a Raspberry Pi for our local museum in Groitzsch.

## Install Pixel OS

Just follow the official documenation:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/quickstart/

## Configured resolution for old monitor 1280x1024

This can be done more easily in the command line config tool: raspi-config

## Install Video looper

Instead of crafting my own video looper I just used this one:

I configured the source of the videos to be read from the SD card.
